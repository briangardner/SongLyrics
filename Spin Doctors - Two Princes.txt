One, two Princes kneel before you
(That's what I said now)
Princes, Princes who adore you
(Just go ahead now)
One has diamonds in his pockets
(That's some bread now)
This one, he wants to buy you rockets
(Ain't in his head now)

This one, he got a princely rocket
(That's what I said now)
Got some big seal upon his jacket
(Ain't in his head now)
Marry him, your father will condone you
(How 'bout that now)
Marry me, your father will disown you
(He'll eat his hat, now)

Aww, marry him or marry me
I'm the one that loves you baby, can't you see
Ain't got no future or a family tree-
But I know what a Prince and lover ought to be
I know what a Prince and lover ought to be

Said, if you want to call me baby
(Just go ahead, now)
An' if you want to tell me maybe
(Just go ahead, now)
If you wanna buy me flowers
(Just go ahead, now)
And if you want to talk for hours
(Just go ahead, now)
