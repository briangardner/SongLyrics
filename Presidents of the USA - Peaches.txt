Movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat me a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Peaches come from a can, they were put there by a man In a factory downtown
And if I had my little way, I'd eat peaches everyday
Sun soakin' bulges in the shade

Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches

I took a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you woman
I poked my finger down inside, made a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or a can or pie

Yeah, yeah...

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free...Look out!
